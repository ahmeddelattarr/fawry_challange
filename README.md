* Products are rejected from the cart if:

  * Expired (`date.today() > expiry_date`)
  * Quantity requested exceeds available stock
* Shipping cost: **30 EGP per kg**
* Shippable items must implement:

  * `get_name()`
  * `get_weight()`
* The system auto-skips failed `add()` attempts but logs them.
